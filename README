A fun little project answering the question no one asked, what does a ray-tracer look like in Clojure?

For most people the answer is, 'Get back evil-creature!'. For others, there's cexirt.

Building
========

Ok it's a mess but I reckon it's still better organised than most Lisp projects out there.. (ouch!)

1. Build basic_exr
  basic_exr is a tiny-winy c++ library to write OpenEXR images. To build it you'll first need:
    OpenEXR - obviously
    cmake - configure the build
    ruby1.9+ - to meta-configure the Building

All the above are available in Macports..

2. Lein Run/repl/compile/uberjar your way to goodness in cexirt

There's little separation between 'testing' and 'running' currently.  The results of 
running really depends on the last commit *evil grin*.
